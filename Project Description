Project Description: Wi-Fi Sniffer Tool

The Wi-Fi Sniffer Tool is a Python-based application designed to monitor and capture Wi-Fi packets in real time. Using the powerful scapy library, the tool allows you to listen to network traffic, extract information about connected devices, and analyze the data flowing through your local wireless network.

This project is intended for educational purposes, helping you understand network protocols and packet structures. Important: Always ensure you have permission to monitor the network you are analyzing, as unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal in many jurisdictions.
Features
